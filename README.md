Replication code in R for the new paper ['Indian urban workers' labour
market transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05482) by
[Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya](https://www.jyotirmoy.net).

The results of the analysis are in the files starting with `res_` in
the `artefacts` folder. This are generated by the Rmd files at the
top-level in `src` which work on the imported data stored in the 
`.parquet` files in `artefacts`.

To redo the import and matching steps place the original PLFS data files
in the `data` folder according to the instructions in the README file 
in that folder. Then run `src/prepare/import_data.Rmd`, 
`src/prepare/rewrite.Rmd` and `src/prepare/mock_rewrite.Rmd` in that
order.

This project uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html). 
Installing the `renv` package and running `renv::restore()` in R at the
top-level of the repository will install all the dependencies of this
project. 

The project stores the imported data in Apache Parquet files
which are gzip compressed. If your installation of R's `arrow` package
does not include gzip support, run `arrow::install_arrow(minimal=FALSE)`
in R.
